# Xbox-360-RGH3-Exploitation

**Before I begin with this write-up, I'd like to make it clear that all content contained here is for educational and research purposes only**


Released on November 22, 2005, the Microsoft Xbox 360 quickly became the most popular and innovative home gaming console to ever exist in just a short years time. The console promised endless content with thousands of different titles and a newly emerging online platform designed to bring together gamers from across the world. Similarly, this marked a new age of security on both a software and a hardware level.

As the years went on, various vulnerabilities were discovered on early kernel versions and it allowed attackers to circumvent the number of protections in place to obtain full control of the console. As you can imagine, these were quickly patched with software updates also known as "Dashboard" updates.

However in 2011, the first ever reset glitch hack Xbox 360 exploit was released by a developer known as Gligli. The concept was simple yet ingenious: introduce precise timing glitches to the CPU during the boot process, causing it to misinterpret instructions and allowing the execution of unsigned code. This method became known as the Reset Glitch Hack (RGH1). It required hardware modifications, such as reading/writing the nand, and installing a mod chip on the inside of the control to act as a central unit to send the glitch pulses.

This method in general marked what would become the standard modification in the Xbox 360 scene and only a year later RGH2 was released which used a different method of slowing down the CPU to precisely send the glitch pulse to the CPU. Previously PLL bypass was used whereas with RGH2, I2C slowdown was used.

Still not perfect, it was slightly an improvement over RGH1 and supported all dashboards all the way up to the current one as of 2024. The problem with these methods were that they were very difficult to tune because it relied on the CPU being in a slowed down state where a reset signal(glitch) can be sent to the processor which would cause it to essentially bypass a check in the secure boot chain allowing for unsigned code execution. The current options for slowing down the CPU were limited and it wasn't always precise meaning that it could go through multiple CPU reset before a successful glitch was achieved.

Once again, over a number of years, improvements on the original RGH1 was made in the form of RGH 1.2(released by 15432) and it was marked the first time in Xbox 360 history where a reset glitch hack had near a perfect glitch rate with proper tuning files for a user's respective glitch chip.

Fast forward to 2021, developer 15432 anounces that he has developed a new method of reset glitch hacking the Xbox 360, but this time, it required no additional glitch chip in the console at all. Instead, the idea was that when the NAND of the console is written, the System Management Controller(SMC) is also written with code that essentially will act as the sender of the glitch signal. The method still used a PLL based slowdown which was able to slow the CPU to almost 650 times slower than normal and with the SMC sending the signal it can be precisely timed to successfully glitch the processor.

This was a massive breakthrough and became the first time in Xbox 360 history where the average person could modify their console with nothing but 2 wires and a soldering iron.

It supported all consoles from the "Phat" Falcon/Jasper motherboards to Trinity/Corona motherboards(excluding Winchester as hardware changes were made to prevent POST from being read from the CPU by introducing a filter-like state from my understanding.) There is over a decade of history when it comes to Xbox 360 vulnerabilites and exploits, but as far as RGH(Reset Glitch Hack) goes, this was the brief overview of where it all began.


For the past several years since the release of RGH1.2 taken up the hobby of modifying consoles with the best current exploit. In this write-up I will have photos of my most recent project with a console I was able to source from a local seller for no more than $20. I wasn't even sure if the console was functional as power cables weren't included and it was stored away for many years according to the seller. Nontheless, I took the gamble and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was in fact funcional, albeit very dusty inside, but still working as it should.

My goal was to RGH3 this console and install an internal LED strip on the fan using the 12v power rail supplied by the PSU. Similarly, I wanted to change the ROL(Ring of Light) LEDs to a variety of colors to match this new LED strip I planned to install. 

Firstly, I disassembled the console and gave it a good cleaning with some 91% Isoprophyl alcohol and made sure to remove any old thermal paste that was present under the XCGPU(the integrated CPU/GPU on the motherboard.)

As we can see here and from the manufacture date(not shown) on the console, this was a Trinity motherboard. The key indicator here is the HANA chip being a standalone SOC whereas in the Corona(the other later Slim motherboard revision) it is integreated in the XCGPU. 

Secondly, on the bottom of the board we have 4 points that we will need to solder to

In this photo, I have them covered in flux to prep them for tinning. 

For the Trinity motherboards, it is recommended that a 3k-10k Ohm resistor is used between the CPU_PLL and the SMC_PLL due to the differing values between the two points. I prep my wire like so.

Heat shrink tubing is used to prevent any shorts from the exposed wire. 

After this, it's time to scrape the PCB mask off the PLL point. I had forgotten to take a photo of this on my install, but generally it will look like so

After soldering to that point we wire it down to the SMC_PLL and try our best to avoid noisy areas to prevent any unnecessary interference in the lines.

Likewise we solder the CPU_POST to the CPU_RST which is also shown as the top wire in the image above.

Note: I probably could've used better pictures of my soldering, but my main goal was just to show how it can be down with basic household items. I did eventually go back and retin and trim some of the excess wire lengths before reassembling.

Up to this point, the console has successfully been wired to work with RGH3, now we just need to dump our NAND and write a custom image back with a modified SMC as well to act as our glitcher.

Flipping the board back over, I tinned up the NAND SPI headers and attached my janky XFlasher wires to their respective points to allow us to read/write the NAND firmware.

From here, we can plug the console in and give it basic standby power which will allow us to interface with the NAND/SMC. After which we use JRunner to dump the nand, validate it, and generate our first piece of modified firmware, XeLL(Xenon Linux Loader) a custom bootloader which will dump data about the NAND such as the DVD drive decryption key as well as the CPU decryption key among other data such as fuse sets etc.

After the tiny custom image has been created, we write this back to the console.

From this point, fresh thermal paste is applied and the proprietary X-Clamp mechniams underneath the XCGPU heat sink is reinstalled.

The console is ready to be booted.

Generally RGH3 has an instant boot time due to it's precise glitching so we immediately see that the mod was a success and we are greeted with our blue XeLL screen and moments later granted the data we need to officially decrypt our NAND dumps that we took earlier.

We take this CPU key and enter it into JRunner and we see that immediately the decryption is successful and essential console-unique files are shown. Now that we have this key, we can craft yet another custom image called Freeboot. This software is essentially the stock Xbox 360 firmware with various security checks removed which will allow us to run unsigned code on the Xbox 360 OS itself.

After we have written this last image, we can boot the console once more to see that it will boot back into what seemingly appears to be the stock Xbox 360 OS.

At this point, we have successfull modifed the Xbox 360 console and essentially removed any code signing restriction from the console.

Now, it's time to make it look cool. I used a basic roll of 12v LED strips to put around the fan and used my multimeter to find a 12v power point on the top side of the board(ideally I didn't want to have to run any wires underneath the board from where the power cord is plugged in) and sure enough, on the right side of the resisor in the image, 12v power is present. So I go ahead tin it, and use it and ground the strip to the metal shielding on the console itself.

After tucking the wires down(since the HDD caddy is located directly above that area) we are able to test it and... success!

That isn't all though, the front ROL(Ring of Light) board needed to match so I took care of that as well. The photos below depict the before and after my custom LEDs were installed as well as the part before I installed the new LEDs. Removign the old ones is fairly simple with enough flux and not too much heat on the iron, flicking them off one by one basically. Peep how small the pads are and how precise the work done on them are.

At this point, everything I wanted to do on this console was completed and I was able to test and reassemble the console shell. The remaining images show the finished colors as well as an image of an example of unsigned code being ran in the form of Dashlaunch a widely used Xbox 36o homebrew application.

Overall, this specific modifcation is a lot of fun and I have successfully done it at least 100+ times. Credits are given to those that have dedicated years to the research of the Xbox 360 from the kernel to the hardware itself. With the ability to put the control into the hands of the owners of these incredible units, it allows for the Xbox 360 to forever be a piece of hardware that will be remembered for its massive collaboration of security researchers and gamers all over the world.
